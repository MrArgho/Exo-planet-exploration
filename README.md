# Exo-planet-exploration
My Computer Graphics' project. In this I used OpenGL 3.3. There is a star and an exo-planet. There is a UFO to travel around the solar system. When the UFO comes close to the planet, the planetâ€™s gravity pulls it and UFO attaches with the planet, then you can launch sattelite. After using sattelite you can observe the planet's surface.

## Basic commands
* Up, Down, Left, Right, R_shift, R_Ctrl : UFO Movement
* 0 : Satellite launch
* I, J, K, L : Satellite movement
* BACKSPACE : Deep Inspection
* P, M : Spot Light on/off
* N, B : Directional Light on/off
* 1, 2 : Ambient on/off
* 3, 4 : Diffuse on/off
* 5, 6 : Specular on/off
* W, S, A, D : Camera movement

## Prerequisites
Install Visual Studio. Clone this repo. Edit the *include* and *library* with your own path, replace the *glad.c* file with your own. Then simply run.
